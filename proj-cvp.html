                                    <p>We were given the prompt based on <a href="https://chi2017.acm.org/designcompetition.html" target="_blank">CHI 2017 Design Competition: Leveling the Playing Field</a> to identify <span class="highlight">a design target that's often excluded or left behind</span> and create a design intervention accordingly.</p>
<!--
                                    <p>Besides the CHI brief, we were also constrained to work on the project through the following two lenses: </p>
                                    <ul>

                                    <h3>Picking a User Group: Student Veterans</h3>
                                    <p>The foremost difficulty of this project was for us to pick a user group in a very limited time frame. To efficiently acoomplish the task while ensuring everyone on the team was on the same page, we adopted the <span class="highlight">affinity diagram</span> method after having an in-depth discussion about the prompt.</p>
                                    <div class="row">

                                            <h4>How we did affinity diagram</h4>
                                            <p>We each wrote down our understanding, intepretation, or questions toward the challenge, and potential user groups on a stack of post-it-notes. Later organized them into different categories: demographic groups, problems, questions (about the prompt) and solutions.</p>

                                            <h4>Why Student Veterans</h4>
                                            <p>Some of the user groups other than student veterans that we were initially interested were foster child, single-mother, and mentally disordered. However, with what the CHI brief emphasized: "<span class="highlight">where ongoing access and engagement is possible</span>" in mind, we came to the decision of addressing student veterans with our design.</p>

                                    <p>For student veterans, it is very difficult <span class="highlight">to connect within a community</span> after transitioning from active duty to civilian student.</p>

                                    <p>We spoke with several student veterans at Indiana University Students face-to-face and two student veterans ar other university on the phone to get insights on following issues:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>What's some difficulties they faced while finding school?</li>
                                        <li>What's some difficulties they faced first coming to [current university]?</li>
                                        <li>What are some of the veteran services offering by the university? Are they helpful? Anything that they wish to have?</li>
                                        <li>What are some differences between them and normal students in terms of needs and problems?</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>To better understand current veteran services</h3>
                                    <p>We talked to John Summerlot, Director of Veteran Support Services (VSS) at Indiana University, and Mary Elftman, Veteran Services Officer at the Monroe County Veterans Affairs. Our goal for these conversations were to identify where we can intervene and to seek for potential support. Some of the questions we asked are:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>What are some veteran services that's currently being offered?</li>
                                        <li>What are some limitation they faced when assisting veterans?</li>
                                        <li>Is there any problem they observed yet being addressed under current system?</li>
                                        
                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>To better understand the problem on a larger scale</h3>
                                    <p>We went through information provided by U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and referred to several reports and research articles* to gain deeper knowledge on veterans as a whole. This also validated our assumptions that the problems we found through previous conversations were not specific to Indiana University but a serious issue on a national level.</p>

                                    <p>Following the affinity diagram and research, we came to some initial conclusion that among all the issues mentioned by the veterans, we would like to focus on <span class="highlight">faciliating them being connected to each other and the university</span>. We believed being connected is <span class="highlight">the very basic step to solve other problems</span> such as academic or mental issues. Without the student veterans being connected to his peers and the university, it is nearly impossible for any other resources and services to reach them.</p>

                                            <p>We aimed to provide a centralized location for all the information that is specifically for veterans. In other words, <span class="highlight">everything in the portal is specific to student veterans, and everything for student veterans are in one place</span>.</p>
                                            <p>Our portal would consist of the student veteran's profile and four sections: Network, Resources, Map, and Events. More detailed explaination for each section would be presented along with our final solution below.</p>

                                    <p>We made the decision early on that we did not want to build another social media that pushes interactions to happen. On the contrary, we would like to provide opportunities of connection for those who are in need of. Our later conversations with the student veterans of IU also supported this idea.</p>
