                                            <p>To understand how the users group and order content, we analyzed the result of the <span class="highlight">card-sorting</span> activities in class with four different groups.</p>

Out of our interview with the program director and staff managing the website, the foremost concern they had was the image the website was portraying to the public, including prospective students, the industry, government &amp; academia, which each had very different needs. At the same time, they also stressed that <span class="highlight">current students should be the top priority</span> when redesigning.</p>

                                            <p>The goal with Course was to provide a clear but comprehensive view on what the programs offered and what were required for graduation, and the foremost challenge with that was the <span class="highlight">great amount and variety of information</span> needed to be presented to both current and prospective students.</p>
                                            <p>To identify what has been the weakness and where the design opportunities were with this section, we conducted <span class="highlight">content audit</span> in collaboration with department staffs to determine if something needs to be regrouped, rewritten or would require different visual material to present them.</p>
