-----------------------BACKGROUND----------------------------------
Challenge: 
Creating a conversational UI for Yelp* leveraging their implementation of Machine Learning system to improve user's experience when ordering food online, especially getting recommendations. 

Problem:
It is labor intensive and time-consuming to use Yelp's current platform. Instead of being able to search using nonspecific words for individual dishes, such as “spicy” or “soupy” they are forced to use a convoluted search process and navigate through reviews to find information specific to the dishes they may be considering.

Constraints: 
- Using BTown Menu* as an entry point
- Focusing on college student only


*Disclaimer: This is a class project with simulated scenarios. We have no affiliation with either Yelp or BTown Menu.

-----------------------RESEARCH----------------------------------

To better understand our users (college students):

We spoke with several Indiana University Students and sent out an online survey to general college students to get responses on following issues:

- What's the usual process they went through when finding food recommendations online?
- What is lacking from current Yelp platform?
- What's their priorities when making food orders?


To better understand finding/ordering food online

We examined both Yelp & BTown Menu's current platform and their potential competitors such as zomato and foodpanda to gain more knowledge on:

- What's the possible processs of getting food recommendations online currently?
- What's Yelp's advantage over other competitors?

To better understand existing solutions 

We looked at a few conUI for food delivery such as Ozlo and Marsbot to know: 

- What information and how is it provided to the users?
- How is the search / filtering process shown in a conversational format?

-----------------------INSIGHT----------------------------------

From our research, we gathered following insights:

User Behavior
- Users do not always know exactly what food or dish they want to order, but may have an idea, such as something "soupy". 
- Users who regularly use online food ordering platform tend to make repeated order.
- Price is the top priority to corcern for most users.

Current Platform
- Yelp is at best with its huge amount of user ratings and reviews, and it is something we should keep in mind of and take advantage of with our conUI solution.

ConUI
- Using conUI ordering food is indeed more efficient than using other platforms.
- A more personalized conversation would give users a better and more engaging experience.


-----------------------FEEDBACK & ITERATION----------------------------------

Usability Testing

After ideation and sketching, we tested our low-fidelity prototype made with notecards with two college students. The goal is to see if any part of the conversation may cause confusion to the users. A few issues we noted during testing: 
- Our original design does not put enough emphasis on price or ratings, and users would like to see those information prominently featured.
- Users usaully only type very few words in respons to the bot, which is different than our assumptions.
- While the users appreciate seeing dishes as the result, once they see the restaurant, they would still like to see the menu from the restaurants.

Further Constraints

Due to time limitation and the complexity of the nature of conUI, we decided with our final design, we would like to set further constrains other than the ones given by the prompt. 

First, our design would only deal with the process of the bot identifying a specific dish for the users. Any other tasks involved within ordering food online, such as reading through menus or entering payment information, would not be in the scope of our design.

Second, with our presentation, we would only focus on the experience of an returning user. For the reason that is the scenario that can best illustrate our idea of taking advantage of a user's past orders information to acheive personalization.


Iteration

After receving feedback from potential users and our peers after presentation, we gathered as a team and discussed where we wanted to move forward. The most significant issue we tried to address during the itration phase (one week) of the project was the display of dish information, including price, rating, review, etc. Below are some of the alternatives we came up with.
