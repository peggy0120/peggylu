                                    <p>For director Chang, her top concern for the website is how it would portray the department's image to the public. </p>
                                    <h4>User Groups</h4>
                                    <p>While public image is one of the major purposes for the website, Director Chang believed that in terms of user groups, current students should also be the priority.</p>

                                    <p>The survey showed that for current students, they mostly used the website to search for courses available, and to look up the professors' office hours. For them, they were most unsatisfied with the website about:</p>

                                <p>To observe current trends in web design and to draw ideas from others, we <span class="highlight">looked at five renowned library &amp; information science departments' website</span> to conduct website benchmarking from several aspects.</p>
                                <p>The websites we looked at are:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>University of Washington Information School (UW iSchool)</li>

                                    <h3>Navigation</h3>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><span class="highlight">Audience Segmentation</span>: 
                                         <ul>
                                            <li>All three US iSchool (UW, UM, Rutgers) websites are segmented with audience, and provided specific page with information for that specific user groups.</li>
                                            <li>The user groups that these websites have in common are "Future Students, Current Students, Faculties, and Alumni".</li>
                                            <li>They <span class="highlight">reflect the program's mission and vision for the website</span>. For example, UW iSchool, being the founder of iSchool consortium, has the "Partners" in their segmentation in particular.</li>
                                         </ul> </li>
                                        <li>Navigation Bar: Most of the navigation bars list similar items. One thing that stand out to us is that both UMSI &amp; Rutgers has "Directory" showing their faculties and students, which is something that's not common with Taiwan's university website.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p>"Purpose" implies the first impression a user has with the website, which usually has great influence on how the user perceives the organization.</p>

                                                <li>Most of the websites we looked at have similar homepage style with the title / logo on the top left corner, the horizontal navigation bar, and the carousel. Below the carousel, there are usually grids showing other contents, and the footer with contact information</li>
                                                <li>Carousel: the items that are commonly shown on the carousel include news, student or faculty achievement. </li>

                                                <li>We found that for all the navigation bars we looked at, the number of categories falls between 6 to eight, and the categories are similar among them.</li>
                                                <li>However, there is a <span class="highlight">difference between the US and Taiwanese websites</span> that for the American ones, they usually prioritize the program and research, while the Taiwanese ones usually have news and about as the first two categories.</li>

                                            <h4>How we did cardsorting</h4>
                                            <p>We started by writing down the categories and items we found the website should contain individually onto the post-it notes. After that, we first put the categories (the pink post-it notes) into the order in terms of importance for the website, and later we reorganize all the items under the categories.</p>

                                    <h3>Major changes made</h3>
                                    <p>Here are the most significant changes we made from the old website with our solution. The detailed changes can be seen below with our <a href="#pj-desg">wireframes</a></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><span class="highlight">Audience Segmentation</span></li>
                                        <p>We decided to add audience segmentation (Perspective Students, Current Students, Faculties, Alumni &amp; Visitors) to our website's structure to address to the specific needs of different user groups. What are included in each audience segmentation page can be seen below with our wireframes.</p>
                                        <li><span class="highlight">Simplifying Structure</span></li>
                                        <p>One of the major problems students have with the old website is there were too many layers and categories in terms of structure, and the information was not organized in an easy-to-understand way. Therefore, we decided to keep the number of categories on navigation bar to 7, following the convention we observed in other websites.</p>
                                        <li><span class="highlight">Reordering the Categories</span></li>
                                        <p>We reordered the categories according survey results and the director's vision for the new website. At the same, we try to group categories that have related purpose next to each other to save user's time in finding information. For example, for "Course" and "Resource", the targeted audiences are mainly current students, so we put the two next to each other on the navigation bar. The same also applies to "About" and "Admission" that are more directed at perspective students.</p>

                            <h2>New Website</h2>
                            <article>
                                <p>Our wireframe received positive feedback from our peers and professor during class presentation, and it was <span class="highlight">used as the foundation for the NTULIS Website Design Team that was later founded during the summer of 2014</span>. The design team was formed by students from the department with department director, professors, and staff managing the website involved. Below is how the redesigned website look like with the theme I proposed to the team.</p>
                                <div class="cont-img"> 
                                    <img src="projects/ntulis_ia/new_.png">
                                </div>
                                <p>The new website put an emphasis on giving out a modern and welcoming look by adding featured images and headings about student events and achievements to capture the audience's attention. At the same time, the website implement audience segmentation, and clearer announcement and calendar for current students.</p>
                                <h3>My contribution on the new design team</h3>
                                <p>I and my teammate E.L. Wang were responsible for the "Course" category of the website, including restructuring information and UI design. We rewrote each page, transformed some of the content into tables and diagram when appropriate. Below are some of the works we did:</p>

                                        <h4>Content Inventory</h4>
                                        <p>We started by listing out each page needed for the new website under "Course", what format it should be, how it should be redesigned, and if there's any reference we can use.</p>

                                        <h4>Redesigned CourseMap</h4>
                                        <p>We redesigned the CourseMap diagram with a more concise look and updated information, which aimed to provide both current and perspective students an overview of how the program was structured and what courses needed to be taken in order to achieve graduation.</p>

                                        <h4>Course Schedule</h4>
                                        <p>We designed the UI together and I developed the javascript for it. Our goal for having this course schedule page is to provide an overview of courses being offered by the department at certain semester, and to faciliate students in deciding what courses to take for a new semester. For now, I'm in the process of developing it as an wordpress plug-in.</p>
